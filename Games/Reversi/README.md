Reversi is a two-player, turn-based board game where the objective is to
have more chips of your color on the board than your opponent when there
are no more moves to be made. This implementation of the game allows the
user to play against a friend or against the computer. Separate classes
are used to represent each type of player, and a main driver contains the
majority of the logic for the game.
