Instructions:

To compile the .java files (assuming you are in the same directory
as the target file) type "javac *.java".

To run the Reversi game (assuming you are in the same directory
as Reversi.java) type "java Reversi" followed by either "Human
Human", "Human RandomComputerPlayer", or "RandomComputerPlayer
RandomComputerPlayer" depending on what players you want in 
the game.

-Once you are in the game a board will appear and human players
will be given a list of possible moves. To make a move, simply
type two integers (row column) separated by a space. Computer
players will automatically make a move. The game will end when
either no moves are possible or the board is full.
