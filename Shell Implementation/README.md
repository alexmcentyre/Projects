This program is the compilation of some work performed to gain a better
understanding of shells. Ultimately, we managed to put together a working
shell which is able to perform some basic functions that are typical of
shells, along with some more complicated tasks like pipelining. In general,
this program was completed as an effort to learn the ins and outs of systems
programming.
